Algorithm: Algorithm: Four-Way Traffic Light Control with Count down Display
Step 1: Start
 Step 2: Initialize the System
 • Set all LED pins (Red, Yellow, Green for 4 directions) as OUTPUT.
 • Initialize the TM1637 4-digit 7-segment display and set brightness.
 Step 3: Set LED Logic Arrays
 • Create arrays for RED[], YELLOW[], and GREEN[] for North, East,
 South, and West.
 Step 4: Enter Main Loop
 For each direction in the order: North → East → South → West
 • Turn ON Red LEDs for all directions.
 • Turn OFF Yellow and Green LEDs for all directions.
 • Set RED[Current] = LOW, GREEN[Current] = HIGH.
 • Start 10-second countdown using TM1637 (00:10 to 00:00).
 • Turn OFF Green, turn ON YELLOW[Current].
 • Start 3-second countdown.
 • Turn OFF Yellow, set RED[Current] = HIGH.
 Step 5: Repeat

Code : 
int LEDRed = 13;
int LEDYellow = 12;
int LEDGreen = 11;
int delayT = 500;

void setup()
{
    pinMode(LEDRed, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(LEDYellow, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(LEDGreen, OUTPUT);
}
void loop()
{
    digitalWrite(LEDRed, HIGH);
    delay(delayT);
    digitalWrite(LEDRed, LOW);
    delay(delayT);

    digitalWrite(LEDYellow, HIGH);
    delay(delayT);
    digitalWrite(LEDYellow, LOW);
    delay(delayT);

    digitalWrite(LEDGreen, HIGH);
    delay(delayT);
    digitalWrite(LEDGreen, LOW);
    delay(delayT);
}
