Algorithm
 1. Start
 2. Configure port GPIO0 pin as output pin where Relay are connected.
 3. Send logic 0 to port pin (Turn ON Relay as it is negative triggered relay).
 4. Give a delay of 1 second.
 5. Send logic 1 to port pin.(To turn OFF relay)
 6. Give a delay of 1 second.
 7. Go to step 2
 8. Stop

Code : 
#define RELAY_PIN 0 // Use GPIO0, change to 2 if using GPIO2

void setup() {
  pinMode(RELAY_PIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW); // Set relay OFF at startup (active LOW relays)
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH); // Turn relay ON (for some relay modules, HIGH triggers)
  delay(2000);                   // Wait 2 seconds
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);  // Turn relay OFF
  delay(2000);                   // Wait 2 seconds
}
