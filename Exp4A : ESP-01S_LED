Algorithm : 
1. Start
2. Configure port (connected to GPIO1 for ESP-01 or GPIO2 for ESP-01S) (as
inbuilt LED) pin as output pin where LEDs are connected.
3. Send logic 1 to port pin.
4. Give a delay of 1 second.
5. Send logic 0 to port pin.
6. Give a delay of 1 second.
7. Go to step 2
8. Stop

Code : 

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);  // Initialize the LED_BUILTIN pin as an output
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  // Turn the LED on (Note that LOW is the voltage level
  // but actually the LED is on; this is because
  // it is active low on the ESP-01)
  delay(500);                      // Wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // Turn the LED off by making the voltage HIGH
  delay(500);                      // Wait for two seconds (to demonstrate the active low LED)
}
